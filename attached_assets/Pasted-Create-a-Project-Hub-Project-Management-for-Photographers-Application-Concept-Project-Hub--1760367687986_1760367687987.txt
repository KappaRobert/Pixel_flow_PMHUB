Create a "Project Hub" - Project Management for Photographers

Application Concept: "Project Hub" - A specialized project management desktop/web application for photographers to manage all aspects of their photoshoots, from planning to financial tracking.

Core Features & Detailed Specifications:

1. Project Creation with Templates

    Function: Users can create new projects.

    Templates: Provide pre-defined templates for different shoot types (e.g., Wedding, Portrait, Commercial, Event). Each template should come with a pre-populated checklist of common tasks for that category.

    Customization: Users must be able to create a project from scratch (blank template) or fully customize any pre-existing template.

2. Project Dashboard

    Purpose: A central overview for each project.

    Content:

        Project Status: Visual indicator (e.g., "Planning," "In Progress," "Editing," "Delivered").

        Key Deadlines: Display the next 2-3 most urgent deadlines from the project's task list and calendar.

        Key Contacts: A dedicated section to store and quickly view essential contacts (e.g., Client, Assistant, Makeup Artist, Venue Coordinator).

        Budget Snapshot: A high-level summary showing: Total Budget, Incurred Costs, and Projected Profit/Loss.

3. Checklists & Task Management

    Function: A robust system for creating and managing to-do lists within each project.

    Features:

        Task Creation: Users can add custom tasks (e.g., "Book makeup artist," "Sign contract," "Charge batteries").

        Assignment: Ability to assign tasks to team members (or mark as personal). Each task must have an assignee field.

        Due Dates: Each task should have a settable due date.

        Progress Tracking: Tasks should be markable as "To Do," "In Progress," and "Completed."

        Organization: Tasks should be organizable into sections or sub-lists (e.g., "Pre-Production," "Shoot Day," "Post-Production").

4. Budget Tracker

    Function: A dedicated module for financial oversight within each project.

    Features:

        Planned vs. Actual: A table or list for entering both estimated and actual expenses.

        Expense Items: Users can add line items (e.g., "Studio Rental," "Assistant Fee," "Transportation," "Equipment Rental").

        Fields for each item: Description, Planned Cost, Actual Cost, Payment Status (Paid/Unpaid).

        Automatic Calculation: The system must automatically calculate:

            Total Planned Expenses

            Total Actual Expenses

            Project Profit/Loss (using the formula: Project Budget - Total Actual Expenses).

        Visualization: A simple chart (like a bar chart) comparing Planned vs. Actual costs is highly desirable.

5. Integrated Calendar

    Function: A unified calendar view that aggregates all time-sensitive data.

    Data Sources: The calendar must automatically pull events from:

        Scheduled photoshoots (from the project details).

        Meetings (e.g., client consultations, location scouting).

        Task deadlines (from the project's checklists).

    Features:

        View Options: Day, Week, and Month views.

        Event Details: Clicking on a calendar event should show basic details and provide a link to the respective project.

        Reminders: System-level notifications/reminders for upcoming events and deadlines.

Technical & Design Requirements:

    UI/UX: Clean, modern, and intuitive interface. Prioritize clarity and ease of use over complex features.

    Data Structure: Ensure data is siloed per project. A user should be able to have multiple active projects without data crossover.

    Technology Stack: (You can specify one here, or leave it open. For example: "Use a React/Vue.js frontend with a Node.js/Python backend and a SQL database.")

Example User Flow for Clarity:

    User selects "New Project" -> Chooses "Wedding" template.

    The system creates a project with a pre-filled checklist ("Book venue," "Create shot list," "Send questionnaire to couple").

    User goes to the Budget Tracker and inputs the client's package price as the project budget, then adds planned expenses.

    User assigns the "Book makeup artist" task to their assistant with a deadline.

    The assistant's deadline and the wedding date itself appear automatically in the main Calendar view.

    As actual costs are logged, the Budget Tracker and Project Dashboard update in real-time to show profitability.
